The \emph{semantics} for a first-order language is given by a
\emph{structure} for that language. It consists of a \emph{domain} and
elements of that domain are assigned to each constant symbol. Function
symbols are interpreted by functions and relation symbols by relation
on the domain. A function from the set of variables to the domain is
a \emph{variable assignment}. The relation of \emph{satisfaction}
relates structures, variable assignments and formulas;
$\Sat{M}{!A}[s]$ is defined by induction on the structure of~$!A$.
$\Sat{M}{!A}[s]$ only depends on the interpretation of the symbols
actually occurring in~$!A$, and in particular does not depend on $s$
if $!A$ contains no free variables. So if $!A$ is a sentence,
$\Sat{M}{!A}$ if $\Sat{M}{!A}[s]$ for any (or all)~$s$.

The satisfaction relation is the basis for all semantic notions. A
sentence is \emph{valid}, $\Sat{{}}{!A}$, if it is satisfied in every
structure. A sentence $!A$ is \emph{entailed} by set of
sentences~$\Gamma$, $\Gamma \Entails !A$, iff $\Sat{M}{!A}$ for all
$\Struct{M}$ which satisfy every sentence in~$\Gamma$. A set~$\Gamma$
is \emph{satisfiable} iff there is some structure that satisfies every
sentence in~$\Gamma$, otherwise \emph{unsatisfiable}. These notions are
interrelated, e.g., $\Gamma \Entails !A$ iff $\Gamma \cup \{\lnot
!A\}$ is unsatisfiable.
